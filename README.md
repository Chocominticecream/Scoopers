# Scoopers
 A project made for unity game jam 2024 by tooling gg
 
 A game in which you attempt to expand your ice cream tower by piling ice cream

15/9/2024 - brainstormed basic concepts then coded basic physics , will implement game mechanics tomorrow(sticking to other ice cream + ice cream stats)
16/9/2024 - basic gameplay mechanics implemented! Now Just have to apply meta layers!

TODO:
- ~~basic physics (clamping, sticking to bowl etc)~~
- ~~stick to other ice cream based on rerolling an rng every second and checking if number is below a certain value~~
- ~~make ice cream scoops resizabl depending on how long you hold onto a tray and find a way to calculate height of ice cream stack~~
- ~~shift camera upwards when successfully sticking ice cream to a certain height (remember to adjust the clamping method so that it stops clamping if iskinematic is true)~~
- create more mechanics such as stickiness/value/scoopability/creaminess, these values affect how high the tower can stack and create 3 basic ice cream scriptableobjects 
- scoring/money system
- art + polish
- shop system!

BUGS (those that i cannot recreate exactly at least)
- ice cream will get flung suddenly when placing it on ice cream
