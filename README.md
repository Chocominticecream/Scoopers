# Scoopers
 A project made for unity game jam 2024 by tooling gg
 
 A game in which you attempt to expand your ice cream tower by piling ice cream

15/9/2024 - brainstormed basic concepts then coded basic physics , will implement game mechanics tomorrow(sticking to other ice cream + ice cream stats)

TODO:
- ~~basic physics (clamping, sticking to bowl etc)~~
- stick to other ice cream based on rerolling an rng every second and checking if number is below a certain value
- shift camera upwards when successfully sticking ice cream to a certain height (remember to adjust the clamping method so that it stops clamping if iskinematic is true)
- create more mechanics such as stickiness/value/scoopability/creaminess, these values affect how high the tower can stack and create 3 basic ice cream scriptableobjects 
- scoring/money system
- art + polish
- shop system!
